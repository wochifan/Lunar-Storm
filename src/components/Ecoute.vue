            <p class="biography">I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
                I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Shinier than yours, meatbag. It must be wonderful. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
                You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.
                Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!
                These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Throw her in the brig.</p>
